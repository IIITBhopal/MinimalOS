# Minmal OS

This _project_ is, ultimately, meant to be a fully **posix** compliant operating system.

Right now, I am developing it as a college project with just a handful of features.
Once I have submitted the project for evaluations and got the project marks, I will start
developing this gradually into a fully **posix** compliant operating system with GUI, network stack,
multitasking, etc.

## Project Aims

Objectives of this project for college evaluations :-

	1. Boot into 32-bit protected mode.
	2. Interrupt Handling
	3. Screen and keyboard drivers.
	4. Basic _libc_ purely for the current requirements.
	5. Filesystem.
	6. Basic Memory Management.
	7. Simple Shell.
	8. Basic text editor.
	9. User mode.

I would like to stretch my goals for :-

	1. Network Stack.
	2. Basic Interpreter.

## Current Progress

I will frequently update the current progress of this project.

For now, we have none :)

## Specifications and Documentation

This project is being developed against ***QEMU i386***.

We will port it to other platforms soon.

Documentation will be uploaded soon.

# Installation

Soon to be uploaded

## Contributing

Right now, contributions are restricted to my team members.
As said earlier, once this project leaves the examiners room, it will be open
for all.

P.S. If you do want to contribute to this project, you should open an issue asking to contribute
and hopefully we can give you a feature to implement which is not in the above list.

## Post Scriptum

Apologies, if this repository is not up to the standards of Open Source Software Community.

As this is only meant for a college project, please forgive our _standards_.

I promise to make it up to the mark once this college chore is over.
